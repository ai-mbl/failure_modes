# # Exercise 6: Failure Modes and the limits of Deep Learning

# %% [markdown]
# In the following exercise, we explore the failure modes and limits of neural networks.
# Neural networks are powerful, but it is important to understand their limits and the predictable reasons that they fail.
# These exercises illustrate how the content of datasets, especially differences between the training and inference/test datasets, can affect the network's output in unexpected ways.
# <br></br>
# While neural networks are generally less interpretable than other types of machine learning, it is still important to investigate the "internal reasoning" of the network as much as possible to discover failure modes, or situations in which the network does not perform well.
# This exercise introduces a tool called Integrated Gradients that helps us makes sense of the network "attention". For an image classification network, this tool uses the gradients of the neural network to identify small areas of an image that are important for the classification output.

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Overview:
# In this exercise you will...
# 1. Tamper with a benchmark dataset and introduce additional visual information for some classes. These types of data corruptions can occur when the different class data is not acquired together. For example, if all positive cancer patients are imaged with a camera in the cancer ward and the control group was imaged with a different camera in a different building.
#
# 2. Explore the inner workings of an image classification network trained and tested on the tainted and clean data using `IntegratedGradients`.
#
# 3. Explore how denoising networks deal with or struggle with domain changes.
#
# *NOTE*: There is very little coding in this exercise, as the goal is for you to think deeply about how neural networks can be influenced by differences in data. We encourage you to think deeply about the questions and discuss them in small groups, as well as with the full class during the frequent checkpoints.

# In this section we will make small changes to specific classes of data in the MNIST dataset. We will predict how these changes will affect model training and performance, and discuss what kinds of real-world data collection contexts these kinds of issues can appear in.

# ## Part 1.1: Local Corruption of Data

# First we will add a white pixel in the bottom right of all images of 7's, and visualize the results. This is an example of a local change to the images, where only a small portion of the image is corrupted.

# Task 1.1: </h4>
# We have locally changed images of 7s artificially for this exercise. What are some examples of ways that images can be corrupted or tainted during real-life data collection, for example in a hospital imaging environment or microscopy lab?
# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **1.1 Answer:**
#
# In a microscopy lab, sample preparation error such as improper staining or sample contamination or other technical issues such as optical aberrations and focus drift can cause image corruption. Environmental factors such as vibrations or lighting variations may also contribute to image corruption. Digital artifacts like compression artifacts or noise, and other issues like operator error (improper manipulation, incorrect magnification...) will also lead to corrupted images.
#
# In a hospital imaging environment, motion artifacts (patient movement), technical issue (equipment malfunction, machine calibration errors), environmental factors (electromagnetic interference, temperature fluctuations), operator errors (improper positioning, incorrect settings), biological factors (metal implant, body motion from bodily functions) are all sources of corrupted data.

# Task 1.2: </h4>
# In your above examples, if you knew you had a local corruption or difference between images in different classes of your data, could you remove it? How?
# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **1.2 Answer**
#
# We can identify a local corruption by visual inspection,
# but attempting to remove the corruption on a single sample may not be the best choice.
# Cropping the corrupted region in all the samples will guarantee that the information of the contaminated
# area will be ignored across the dataset.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 1.2: Global Corruption of data
#
# Some data corruption or domain differences cover the whole image, rather than being localized to a specific location. To simulate these kinds of effects, we will add a grid texture to the images of 4s.

# %% [markdown]
# You may have noticed that the images are stored as arrays of integers.
# First we cast them to float to be able to add textures easily without integer wrapping issues.

# Then we create the grid texture and visualize it.

# Create grid texture

texture[::2, ::2] = 80
texture = convolve(texture, weights=[[0.5, 1, 0.5], [1, 0.1, 0.5], [1, 0.5, 0]])
texture = torch.from_numpy(texture)

# Next we add the texture to all 4s in the train and test set.

# Task 1.3:</h4>
# Think of a realistic example of such a corruption that would affect only some classes of data. If you notice the differences between classes, could you remove it? How?
# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **1.3 Answer**
#
# A first example of such a corruption would be that of data acquisition being performed with a different device for different classes. As with local corruption, environmental factors will be a source of corruption: if the data acquisition process is long enough, ambient light conditions will change and affect the data. Similarly, vibrations in the surrounding room may have an impact.
#
# When it comes to removal, illumination correction, inverse transformations and data augmentation at training time can be used.
#
# But prevention remains the most effective way to produce high quality datasets.

# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **1.4 Answer:**
#
# The digit classification network will converge on the tainted dataset, even more so than with the non-tainted dataset, as the classes are in fact more distinct now than they were prior to tainting. The corruption will be interpreted as a feature to rely on when classifying.

# If you want to test your hypotheses, you can create these all-dots and all-grid train and test datasets and use them for training in bonus questions of the following section.
# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **Bonus question solution for Checkpoint 1**
#
# 1. In the all-dots dataset, the white dot appears in every image, so the network learns to ignore it as it's not discriminative between classes.
# 2. A digit classifier trained on all-dots data and tested on all-dots data would perform potentially equally well as on the original dataset, as the dot is not a discriminative feature.
# 3. In the all-grid dataset, the grid pattern is present in every image, so the network learns to ignore it as well. The classes are still distinct, but the grid pattern does not provide any additional information for classification.
# 4. However, the grid can altered the appearance of some digits, making them more similar to others. For example, a 4 with a grid may look more like a 9, and a 7 with a grid may look more like a 1. This can lead to confusion between these classes.

#
# The clean model on the clean dataset predicted 5s least accurately, with some confusion with 6s and 3s.
# These are likely confused by the model as handwritten 5s may look like 6s (almost closed bottom part) or 3s (presence of 3 horizontal segments).

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **3.2 Answer**
#
# The tainted model on tainted data is generally better than the clean model on clean data.
# Clean/clean does ever so slightly better on 3s and 8s, but 4s and 7s are quite significantly better identified in the tainted/tainted case,

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **3.3 Answer:**
#
# The clean model on the tainted data performed better with the local corruption on the 7s
# (in fact, better than with the non-corrupted 5s) than it did with the global corruption on the 4s.
# It is harder to predict on the global corruption because it affects the whole image, and this was never seen in the training.

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **3.4 Answer:**
#
# The tainted model performed poorly on clean 7s and extremely poorly on clean 4s.
# Global corruption effectively prevented the tainted model from learning any feature about 4s,

# ### Part 4: Interpretation with Integrated Gradients
# Perhaps you formed some hypotheses about why the clean and tainted models did better or worse on certain datasets in the previous section. Now we will use an attribution algorithm called `IntegratedGradients` (original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01365.pdf)) to learn more about the inner workings of each model. This algorithm analyses a specific image and class, and uses the gradients of the network to find the regions of the image that are most important for the classification. We will learn more about Integrated Gradients and its limitations in the Knowledge Extraction Lecture and Exercise.

# %% [markdown]
#
# Below is a function to apply integrated gradients to a given image, class, and model using the Captum library
# (API documentation at https://captum.ai/api/integrated_gradients.html).

    model.zero_grad()

    # Get input and target tensors from test_input
    input_tensor = test_input[0].unsqueeze(0)
    input_tensor.requires_grad = True
    target = test_input[1]

    # Run attribution:
    attributions = algorithm.attribute(
        input_tensor, target=target, baselines=input_tensor * 0

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **4.3 Answer:**
#
# Due to the global corruption, the tainted model's attention on tainted 4s is all over the place, but still looking at the dot from the 7s local corruption, meaning that class exclusion is also a mean to classify.

# Did the denoising net trained on MNIST work well on unseen test data? What do you think will happen when

# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **5.1 Answer:**
#
# The denoising MNIST did relatively well considering it extracted images which allows a human to
# identify a digit when it wasn't necessarily obvious from the noisy image.
# It has however been trained to look for digits. Applying it to Fashion-MNIST will possibly sucessfully "remove noise",
# but recovering objects that it hasn't seen before may not work as well.

# Similar to the regular MNIST, we will use the pytorch FashionMNIST dataset.
# This was downloaded in the setup.sh script, so here we are just loading it into memory.

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **5.2 Answer:**
#
# The "noise" is apparently gone, however, the objects are hardly recognizable.
# Some look like they have been reshaped like digits in the process.

# Can you imagine any real-world scenarios where a denoising model would change the content of an image?
# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **5.3 Answer:**
#
# If a denoising model is trained on data which does not appear in the data it is ultimately used on,
# that new content will end up likely changed. A real worl example could be that of training a model on lots of non-dividing cells images,
# and use the model on new data which happens to contain some dividing cells. This could lead to the information being "denoised" away.

# How does the new denoiser perform compared to the one from the previous section? Why?
# </div>

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# **5.4 Answer:**
#
# The new denoiser has been trained on both MNIST and FashionMNIST, and as a result, it no longer insist on reshaping objects from the FashionMNIST dataset into digits. However, it seems to be performing slightly worse on the original MNIST (some of the digits are hardly recognisable).
# If you look more closely at the code, you'll notice that we haven't shuffled the data in our `DataLoader`. This means that every epoch the model will first train on all of the MNIST data, then on all of the FashinMNIST.
# The effect that we're seeing here, where it's performing worse of the MNIST data, points to an important lesson: Models Forget!
# If the model is trained for too long without any MNISt examples, as it is here, it begins to overwrite what it has learned about that data.
# %% [markdown]
# ### Train the denoiser on both MNIST and FashionMNIST, shuffling the training data

# We previously performed the training sequentially on the MNIST data first then followed by the FashionMNIST data. Now, we ask for the training data to be shuffled and observe the impact on performance. (note the `shuffle=True` in the lines below)
