Now we will use an attribution algorithm called `IntegratedGradients` (original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01365.pdf)) to learn more about the inner workings of each model. This algorithm analyses a specific image and class, and uses the gradients of the network to find the regions of the image that are most important for the classification.
